How does rails communicate with the database?  Please be thorough in discussing all the config files and pieces of rails necessary to communicate with the database.

Rails communicates with the database through the model. The model tells the database what to save. This tells the relationship between parameters in the database.  You can generate a migration in the command line, and then run it using rake db:migarate.  This creats a migration with a columns that will be persisted into the database.
